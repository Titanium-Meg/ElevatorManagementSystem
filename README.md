# Elevator Management System

## Description

The Elevator Management System (EMS) is a simulation of a building's elevator system. It allows users to request elevators to specific floors within the building and simulates the movement of elevators and opening/closing of doors. The aim of the project was to understand Software Devolpment Life Cycles and also battle the complexities of an EMS system, i.e. elevator with the closest proximity must complete a request, 
if an elevator is going up and a passenger presses a lower floor number the elevator must complete its path before changing direction, etc.
